# Todo App in HTML CSS and JavaScript

This todo app which is available at https://charumathib.github.io/todoapp-html-css-js/ was based on [this tutorial](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-a-simple-to-do-list-with-html-css-and-js) with several modifications made to the styling and to extend functionality.

Users first select the class they want to add todos by clicking either `CS 279r` `CS242` or `STAT 139` on the bar of tabs. They can then type in a can type in a todo in the input box at the top of the screen which will pop up as a task under the chosen tab when the user clicks `Add`. Users can switch between tabs to see the tasks added to them.

Each task has three buttons that allow users to take actions on them. The 🔥 button marks the task as important and surrounds it with a red border. The ✔️ button marks the task as complete and grays it out. The 🗑️ button deletes the task from the list.
